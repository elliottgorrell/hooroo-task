# Qantas Hotels Interview Task

This is my submission for the interview task for Qantas Hotels.

It has been fun but alot more learnings than I expected!
I haven't done any web development except for a side project here and there in a few years so have had to catch up with the latest practices while doing this task.

Some of the new things I ended up doing were:
* `css-grid` instead of bootstrap for layout
* MY FIRST EVER foray into frontend testing.

It is a CRA(create-react-app) so standard practices apply to using the repo.
